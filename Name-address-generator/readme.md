Step 1) Download files
Step 2) Download and install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
Step 3) Install python and open Pythonw.exe, python for windows.
Step 4) open 'name-address-gen.py', and go to the Run Menu > Run Module.

The script will generate one address using the four CSV sheets.

Someone could pretty easily add a counter and a for loop to print multiples, 
or just copy paste the last 3 print statements a bunch to get a bunch of addresses.

For educational purposes only, this is a programming project.
